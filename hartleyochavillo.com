	    <p style=color:skyblue>Just kidding. I'm actually human. Very <a href="https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/v/t1.0-9/10423919_10152944125357502_2586881242683822207_n.jpg?oh=7230d54c71bfdcf3a2c63dd5dda37a3a&oe=566A1237">human</a>.</p>
	    <p>I am a young man from Guam that moved to California in hopes of making it big. Turns out, no matter where you go, you'll be a small, brown man with big dreams. And when I say "you" I really mean "me". I'm in my mid 20's in the middle of my great career switch.</p>
	    <br>I'm interested in a number of things:
	
	<ul>
	    <li> <a href="https://youtu.be/tV6AQGF2Vfo?t=4m50s">Videogames </a> </li>
	    <li> <a href="http://puppydroolreal.blogspot.com/">Writing</a> </li>
	    <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5FB2WObnQQ">Music</a></li>
	    <li> <a href="http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/">Social Psychology</a>(Please support the Greater Good Science Center if you can!)</li>
	    <li> <a href="http://reddit.com/r/datascience">Data Science</a></li>
	    <li> <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG">Table Top RPGs</a></li>

	</ul>
	   
	I've created this webpage mainly to do one thing: chronicle my journey of learning how to code, and learning how different types of programing languages. I'm hoping to one day get into some serious Data Science and Data Analysis work. I also would like to go into UX work, either as a designer or a researcher. My stretch goal is to eventually get good enough at scripting to create video games and meld all of my interests into one magnum opus of story telling, music, art, and interactive entertainment.

I have no illusions: it will be a long journey that will rely on my diligence and perseverence. It also will depend a lot on how well I can manage my work-life balance. I will do this for about as long as I can. This is the order I'll be learning the various languages of coding:
        <ol>
        <li> HTML & CSS</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>jQuery</li>
        <li>Ruby maybe?</li>
        </ol>
So here goes nothing. This is my journey into the world of coding.
